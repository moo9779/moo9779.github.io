        <p> <strong>My Background:</strong> </p>
        <p> 
        <div class="tab">
               I am a Computer Science major at Boston College. 
               I am from Los Angeles, a senior and I have no prior work experience in the IT section. 
               My work experiences have all been related to the military so far and I do not wish to go 
               into the IT section in the military nor in the civilian world. I hope to go into the business 
               sector or work in the sports industry.

        <p> <strong>My Interest in Web Development:</strong> </p>
        <p> 
        <div class="tab">
            I am not interested in web development because I am not a huge fan of coding. 
            However, I thought it was a good idea to start to learn because I do not know HTML 
            and I never know if I need it in the future. I also find web development interesting 
            because my cousin is a web developer and he loves his job. So I would like to get a little 
            insight as to why.

        <p> <strong>My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports or Hobbies:</strong></p>
        <p> 
        <div class="tab">
            I am an Air Force ROTC cadet and wish to serve as a lieutenant in 
            the near future. I play soccer and enjoy watching it as well. I 
            like to go hiking with my friends as well as riding roller coasters. 
            I also like to go to art museums and enjoy drawing in my free time.

        <p> <strong>What I Hope to Gain from this Course:</strong></p>
        <p> 
        <div class="tab">
            I wish to gain a basic knowledge of how to format and code a 
            website. I also wish to grasp HTML through this course. I enjoy 
            learning things I do not know very much about so if this is an 
            introductory course, I hope to have fun learning.

        <p> <strong> Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About:</strong></p>
        <p>
        <div class="tab">
            I would love to learn about design of websites. 
            I really like art and even though I am not skilled 
            enough to be a designer, I would like to learn the 
            inner workings of graphic design.
