            The Tet Offensive was one of the largest military campaigns of the Vietnam War. It was a series of 
            surprise attacks separated into 3 phases throughout the year of 1968 by the Viet Mong and North 
            Vietnamese People’s Army of Vietnam against the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnamese 
            and the United States and its allies. 
        </li>
        <li >
            Phase 1 was conducted from January 30 - March 28, 1968, phase 2 was conducted from May 5 - June 15, 
            1968, and phase 3 was conducted from August 9 - September 23, 1968 on more than 100 towns and cities, 
            including 36 of 44 provincial capitals, five of the six autonomous cities, 72 of 245 district towns, 
            and the southern capital. Throughout these 3 phases, the Viet Cong used underground roads, called the 
            <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_trail">Ho Chi Minh Trail</a>, 
            to travel throughout the Vietnam. They would use these underground roads for multiple purposes such as cover 
            to hide from the US Air Force or to hide and wait to launch surprise attacks. However, due to superior 
            firepower and training of the US military, the attacks were pushed back. The US military inflicted 
            heavy casualties on the Viet Mong, causing them to cease the Tet Offensive.  
        </li>
        <li >
            In total, United States and its allies suffered 46,000 casualties throughout the 3 phases from their 
            original strength of 1,000,000 soldiers. On the other hand, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army 
            had around 300,000 - 500,000 soldiers and suffered over 110,000 casualties.
        </li>
        <li >
            Even though the Tet Offensive was a tactical victory by the United States and its allies, it was a 
            political and strategic victory by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese. Despite the heavy losses 
            suffered by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army the political setback suffered by the United 
            States was much worse. After the Tet Offensive, 200,00 more soldiers were required from conscription, 
            angering the American public. The American public also were shocked to find out that they were 
            suffering heavy casualties in Vietnam and support of the war declined as they started to question 
            the purpose and motivation behind this war. The American politicians could not ignore the public’s 
            cry and protests of the war, which weakened American resolve and support of the campaign in Vietnam. 
            These public protests and political pressure is one of the major reasons the American military left 
            Vietnam and failing to achieve their objective of supporting South Vietnam. The Viet Cong and North 
            Vietnamese army soon defeated the South Vietnamese army and took control over Vietnam soon after the 
            United States left. The Viet Cong lost the battle through the Tet Offensive but allowed them to win 
            the war.
