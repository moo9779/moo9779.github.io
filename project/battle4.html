            The Battle of the Alamo was one of the most important event in the Texasâ€™ independence from Mexico and 
            assimilation into the United States. It was a 13 day siege by the Mexican army to quell the Texan 
            revolution from February 23 to March 6, 1836.

        <li >
            The Texan revolution began when the people of Texas drove out all Mexican troops out of Texas. 
            General <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna">Antonio Santa Anna</a> 
            of the Mexican army wanted to retake Texas as Mexican territory. As a result, they launched a campaign 
            to take back Alamo from the Texans with 1800 soldiers. The Texan army on the other hand only had around 
            185 to 260 soldiers stationed at Alamo. Even though the Texans were outnumbered 9 to 1, they inflicted 
            heavy casualties to the Mexican army, wounding or killing 400-600 soldiers. However, all of the Texan 
            soldiers who fought at Alamo lost their lives. General Santa Anna reclaimed the Alamo and though that 
            he would quickly reclaim Texas. However, that was not the case.

            The brave warriors at Alamo showed American determination for freedom and displayed warrior ethos by 
            fighting until the very last soldier. In addition, with the defeat at Alamo, General Antonio Santa 
            Anna killed all the Texan inhabitants at Alamo. Having heard of this cruelty and a want for justice, 
            many Texans joined the army to fight the Mexican army and defeating them in 
            <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Jacinto"> April 1936 </a>. 
            Having emerged victorious agains the Mexican army, Texas ended the rebellion and won their independence.
