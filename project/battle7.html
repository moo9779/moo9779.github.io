            The Second Battle of the Marne was the last major German offensive on the Western front during the 
            First World War. The German offensive lasted from 15 July – 6 August 1918 on the Marne River, near 
            Paris, France. There was a stalemate due to the tough environment of the Marne river being a natural 
            barrier for the Allied forces. It was easy to dig deep trenches on both sides and difficult to maneuver 
            tanks and soldiers across the river due to the fast currents of the river and the surrounding muddy 
            environments. As a result, the German’s previous offensive, known as the <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>, 
            was a complete failure. 
        </li>
        <li >
            After the Spring Offensive failed, the German high officers sought planned one more offensive to defeat
            the Allied forces across the Marne. German generals wanted to attack through Belgium and decided to have 
            a large diversion force attack through Marne in order to divert the Allied forces away from Belgium into 
            the Paris part of Marne. As a result, the main German force was near Belgium, not Paris. However, the main
            Allied forces were stationed near the Paris part of Marne. When the second German offensive began, known 
            as the Second Battle of the Marne, the Allied  forces not only stopped the large diversion force, but 
            also because it was not the main German force, the Allied forces were able to launch a large counter-offensive
            attack and break through the German line. This broke the 3 year stalemate on the Marne River. 
        </li>
        <li >
            This battle was one of the bloodiest of the war. For the Allied forces, the French suffered 
            95,000 casualties, Americans 45,000, British 17,000 and Italian, 9000. The Germans suffered 
            140,000 casualties and another 30,000 were captured.  
        </li>
        <li >
            Because the German line was broken, the Germans lost not only the battle, but also the Great War. 
            The victory was a huge morale booster for the Allied forces and immediately after the Second Battle
            of Marne they were gaining victory after victory over the German forces, known as <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days_Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a>. 
            In three months, the Great War ended.
