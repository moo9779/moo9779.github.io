            The Siege of Yorktown was a month long campaign from September 28 to October 19, 1781. It was a victory 
            for the combined force of the American Continental Army and French troops led by General George Washington. 
            Around 19,000 American and French soldiers fought 9000 British soldiers led by Lieutenant General 
            <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis"> Charles Cornwallis</a>. 
        </li>
        <li >
            On land, the British army had control of a port in Yorktown. However, their movements were shadowed by 
            <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette">Marquis de Lafayette </a> and his reconnaissance team. On sea, the French navy defeated the British navy at the 
            <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Chesapeake">Battle of the Chesapeake</a>, impeding the British fleet to gain access and resupply and support their army at 
            Yorktown. As a result, the French navy surrounded the British army at Yorktown on sea with the Continental 
            and French armies surrounding the British on land. General Cornwallis was completely surrounded without 
            resupply of food, water, ammunition, reinforcements and other necessary supplies for an entire month. 
            Finally, on October 19, 1781, General Cornwallis surrendered his 9000 British soldiers.

            The Siege of Yorktown was the last major battle in the American Revolution and battle that won the 
            independence of the colonies. After the surrender of General Cornwallis, the British and American 
            politicians started negotiating a peace treaty, which later was the <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)"> Treaty of Paris</a> in 1783. 
            This treaty officially declared United States as its own country and the colonists won their independence.
