            The Battle of Midway was a naval battle in the Pacific Theatre of World War II from 4-7 June, 1942. 
            This battle took place six months after the the attack on Pearl Harbor. Since the attack on Pearl 
            Harbor, the Japanese army and navy were holding firm and defeating the American counterparts in the 
            Pacific Theatre. The morale was low and nothing seemed to work against the powerful Japanese military.

            However, Midway as the turning point in the Pacific Theatre. This was the most stunning and decisive 
            blow in the history of warfare according to historian John Keegan. Under the command of <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_W._Nimitz">Admiral Nimitz</a>,
             the United States navy won a decisive victory against the Japanese navy. The Japanese navy wanted to lay 
             a trap to sink all American carriers at Midway. However, due to miscommunication and Americans deciphering
              the Japanese code, the US Navy prepared for the ambush and the ambush failed.
        </li>

        <li >
            The Japanese navy lost 4 fleet carriers, 1 heavy cruiser, 248 aircraft and 3057 sailors. 
            The United States only lost 1 fleet carrier, 1 destroyer and 150 aircraft with 307 dead comparatively.
        </li>
        <li >
            After Midway, the Japanese navy lost all of its carriers, a lot of aircraft and most of their 
            well-trained sailors and pilots. Due to this loss, their navy were incapacitated for the rest of 
            the war and the Japanese soldiers and pilots the Americans after were ill-trained or not trained 
            at all, giving the Americans an advantage. Due to losing most of their resources at this battle, 
            Battle of Midway is regarded by many historians as the turning point in the Pacific Theatre.
