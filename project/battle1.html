            The Battles of Lexington and Concord were fought on April 19, 1775. These two battles started the 
            American Revolutionary War which went from 1775 to 1783. Tensions between the 13 colonies and the 
            British Empire were building up prior to these encounters due to many issues, including taxes, 
            representation and exploitation of the 13 colonies by the British Empire. Around 1500 British soldiers 
            and 4000 Massachusetts militia in Lexington and Concord were involved by the end of the day.

            "On the night of April 18, 1775, hundreds of British troops marched from Boston to nearby Concord 
            in order to seize an arms cache. Paul Revere and other riders sounded the alarm, and colonial 
            militiamen began mobilizing to intercept the Redcoat column. A confrontation on the Lexington 
            town green started off the fighting, and soon the British were hastily retreating under intense 
            fire.” -History.com

            The famous words “Shot Heard Around the World” came from Lexington as the shot started the 
            American Revolution. This is the battle that started America's independence and the catalyst of 
            the formation of the United States.
