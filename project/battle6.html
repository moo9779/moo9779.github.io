            The single bloodiest battle in the history of the United States, the Battle of Gettysburg was 
            fought from July 1-3, 1863 in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Previous to this battle, the Confederate 
            Army were gaining victory after victory thanks to the leadership of <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee">General Robert E. Lee</a>. 
        </li>

            General Lee defeated the Union army at Chancellorsville, Virginia and wanted to invade the North by 
            attacking Gettysburg. The Union were defending their positions at Gettysburg when the Confederate 
            army attacked on 1 July 1863. However, for 3 days, the Union army held their lines through their 
            rifle and artillery fire. No sides were able to break the lines of the others and were suffering heavy 
            casualties at the same time. General Lee made a last ditch effort to break Union lines by sending 12,500 
            soldiers towards the center of the Union line, known as <a style="color:rgb(215, 227, 49)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickett%27s_Charge">Pickett’s Charge</a>. However, due to heavy rifle and 
            artillery fire, half of the soldiers suffered casualties and General Lee was forced to retreat.

        <li >
            There were around 100,000 Union soldiers present with 71-75,000 Confederate soldiers. However, just 
            after three days of fighting, the Union army suffered 23,000 casualties with the Confederate army 
            suffering 23-28,000 casualties. This battle is still the bloodiest battle in United States history 
            with around 50,000 American casualties. 
        </li>
        <li >
            After the defeat at Gettysburg, General Lee’s army was stopped from invading into the North. 
            This battle is seen by many historians as the turning point in the war. The Union army first 
            stopped the Confederate army and were able to use this momentum to later defeat the Confederate 
            army. Also, after the battle, President Lincoln presented one of the best orations in history with 
            his Gettysburg’s Address.
