            The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise attack by the Imperial Japanese military on the United 
            States’ naval base at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The United States previously were practicing 
            isolationism, refusing to enter the war in Europe against Nazi Germany. This was due to the shock 
            and heavy tolls taken during WWI and still recovering from the Great Depression.

            However, Japan planned on expanding its empire in Southeast Asia, specifically United States-held 
            territory such as Philippines, Guam and Wake Island. The Japanese saw the United States Navy as a 
            stumbling block that would prevent them from expanding. In order to prevent any stumbling blocks, 
            they wanted to annihilate, or at least incapacitate, the US Navy so that the United States could not 
            interfere with their activities in the Southeast. As a result, they attacked the US Navy stronghold 
            at Pearl Harbor.

            On this day, 2335 Americans were killed with 1143 more wounded. On top of that, the United States lost 
            4 battleships and 188 aircraft with many more battleships and aircraft damaged, requiring repair. The 
            Japanese on the other hand only lost 29 aircraft and 4 submarines.

            The attack prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to deliver one of the most consequential speeches 
            of the 20th century to congress, titled “A date which will live in infamy”. This speech led to Congress
             declaring war on both Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany and the United States entering World War II. 
             Despite the heavy losses suffered by the United States Navy, instead of being incapacitated, the US Navy 
             became stronger. With the declaration of war, Congress approved more funding and the size and capability 
             of the US Navy improved three-fold.
