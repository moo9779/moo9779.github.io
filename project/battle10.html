            The Invasion of Normandy was the single biggest amphibious assault in history at the time of 
            6 June, 1944, or more commonly known as D-Day. The Allied forces invaded German positions in 
            Normandy on the northern coast of France. 
        </li>

        <li >
            Most of the main force were through amphibious landings on the beach on D-Day. However, the day 
            before a large number of parachute and glider forces were deployed behind Normandy and enemy 
            lines in order to aid the amphibious landings. Through sheer number and naval and air bombardments, 
            the Allied forces were able to secure the beaches at Normandy. 
        </li>

        <li >
            Around 1.3 million allied soldiers, pilots and sailors were involved with 120,000 casualties and 
            380,000 German soldiers holding their positions with 113,059 casualties. 
 
        </li>
        <li >
            With this successful invasion, the Allied forces were able to get a foothold in Europe in the north, 
            which was a lot easier to get supplies and reinforcements into mainland Europe than through Italy. 
            This was the start of the counteroffensive of the Allied forces that drove the German forces out of 
            France and into Germany.
