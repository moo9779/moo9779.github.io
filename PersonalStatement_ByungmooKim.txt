‘Personal Statement: Byungmoo Kim’
My Background
	I am a Computer Science major at Boston College. I am from Los Angeles, a senior and I have no prior work experience in the IT section. My work experiences have all been related to the military so far and I do not wish to go into the IT section in the military nor in the civilian world. I hope to go into the business sector or work in the sports industry. 

My Interest in Web Development
	I am not interested in web development because I am not a huge fan of coding. However, I thought it was a good idea to start to learn because I do not know HTML and I never know if I need it in the future. I also find web development interesting because my cousin is a web developer and he loves his job. So I would like to get a little insight as to why.

My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports or Hobbies
	I am an Air Force ROTC cadet and wish to serve as a lieutenant in the near future. I play soccer and enjoy watching it as well. I like to go hiking with my friends as well as riding roller coasters. I also like to go to art museums and enjoy drawing in my free time.

What I Hope to Gain from this Course
	I wish to gain a basic knowledge of how to format and code a website. I also wish to grasp HTML through this course. I enjoy learning things I do not know very much about so if this is an introductory course, I hope to have fun learning. 

Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About
	I would love to learn about design of websites. I really like art and even though I am not skilled enough to be a designer, I would like to learn the inner workings of graphic design.
